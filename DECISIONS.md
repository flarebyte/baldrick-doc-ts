# Architecture decision records

An [architecture
decision](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/architecture-decision-records)
is a software design choice that evaluates:

-   a functional requirement (features).
-   a non-functional requirement (technologies, methodologies, libraries).

The purpose is to understand the reasons behind the current architecture, so
they can be carried-on or re-visited in the future.

## Hero prompt

An old servant with a long white beard is sitting in a wooden chair and reading a large book by candlelight in a dark corner of an Elizabethan library. The book bears the letters TS in capital letters and is so large that it covers the servantâ€™s lap. The scene has a dark satirical tone that mocks the social norms and customs of Elizabethan England. This is a black and white etching.
